## 📊 Insights and Conclusions

The most frequent weather conditions in the dataset are clear and cloudy skies, particularly categories like Mainly Clear, Mostly Cloudy, and Cloudy.

Monthly average temperatures follow a seasonal trend, with January and December being the coldest months (below freezing) and July being the warmest, indicating a temperate climate pattern with distinct winters and summers.

Visibility is inversely related to humidity levels, with higher humidity often leading to reduced visibility.
